      "description": "Indonesia Landing is a static HTML/CSS page with fixed dimensions.\n\nIndonesia Landing is a static landing page built with pure HTML and CSS, without JavaScript frameworks and without responsive behavior. The project demonstrates a classic web design approach with a fixed-width layout, focused on desktop resolutions and pixel-perfect implementation.\n\nImplemented functionality:\n\nFixed-Width Layout:\n- fixed container width (typically 960px, 1024px, or 1200px);\n- centered content positioning on the page;\n- static element sizes without a fluid approach;\n- pixel-perfect implementation of the design layout;\n- focus on desktop resolutions (1280px+).\n\nIndonesia theme:\n- visual presentation of Indonesian culture/tourism;\n- hero section with expressive imagery;\n- informational blocks about landmarks;\n- photo gallery or feature section;\n- typography reflecting an exotic visual theme.\n\nCSS-Driven Design (61.1%):\n- styling-heavy implementation over markup complexity;\n- detailed styling of each element;\n- CSS used for all visual effects;\n- possible use of CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts;\n- CSS hover effects and transitions;\n- careful spacing and typography tuning.\n\nSemantic HTML (38.9%):\n- clean HTML markup without JavaScript logic;\n- structured content via semantic tags;\n- proper heading hierarchy;\n- accessibility-friendly markup;\n- SEO-oriented structure.\n\nKey technical solutions:\n\nFixed-Width Architecture:\n- fixed-width container (for example, .container { width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; });\n- no media queries and responsive breakpoints;\n- static font sizes in px;\n- fixed image sizes;\n- predictable layout across desktop monitors.\n\nCSS Styling Approach:\n- possible CSS methodology usage (BEM, OOCSS);\n- modular styling organization by sections;\n- CSS reset or normalize for cross-browser consistency;\n- float-based or modern Grid/Flexbox layouts;\n- CSS-only decorative elements;\n- gradients, shadows, and border-radius for visual depth.\n\nTypography System:\n- fixed font sizes;\n- clear heading hierarchy with explicit sizing;\n- web-safe fonts or @font-face setup;\n- line-height and letter-spacing for readability;\n- color scheme for text content.\n\nLayout Structure:\n- traditional structure: header, main sections, footer;\n- multi-column content layouts;\n- optional sidebar for additional information;\n- grid-based alignment system;\n- clear separation of visual zones.\n\nImage Integration:\n- static images with fixed dimensions;\n- background-image for decorative elements;\n- image sprites for icons (where needed);\n- optimized file sizes;\n- alt attributes for accessibility.\n\nCSS Effects & Enhancements:\n- hover states for interactive elements;\n- CSS transitions for smooth interactions;\n- box-shadow for depth;\n- gradient backgrounds for visual interest;\n- pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) for decoration;\n- CSS-only buttons and navigation.\n\nCross-Browser Compatibility:\n- vendor prefixes for CSS properties;\n- fallback styles for older browsers;\n- CSS reset for consistency;\n- testing in common browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n\nPerformance Considerations:\n- minimal page weight without JavaScript;\n- optimized CSS files;\n- compressed images;\n- reduced number of HTTP requests;\n- fast initial page load."
